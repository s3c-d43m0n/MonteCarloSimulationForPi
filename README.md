# What is Monte Carlo Simulation?

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling and statistical analysis to model and analyze complex systems or processes.

It is particularly useful when it is difficult to find exact solutions or when there are numerous variables or interactions involved. Instead of solving mathematical equations analytically, Monte Carlo simulation generates random samples from probability distributions that represent uncertain inputs. These samples are used as inputs to a mathematical model, and the model is evaluated to determine the corresponding outputs.

By running a large number of iterations, the simulation provides a statistical distribution of possible outcomes, allowing for the estimation of averages, variances, and other statistical properties. This technique finds applications in finance, engineering, physics, economics, and more, enabling risk analysis, optimization, and decision-making in the face of uncertainty.


# Estimation of PI using Monte Carlo Method

The "Monte Carlo Method" is a method of solving problems using statistics. Given the probability, P, that an event will occur in certain conditions, a computer can be used to generate those conditions repeatedly. The number of times the event occurs divided by the number of times the conditions are generated should be approximately equal to P.

The goal of this problem is to estimate the value of the mathematical constant π (pi) using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The problem involves randomly generating points within a square and determining the ratio of points that fall within a unit circle inscribed within the square. By using the relationship between the areas of the square and the inscribed circle, an approximation of π can be obtained.

The problem can be defined as follows:

* Generate a large number of random points uniformly distributed within a square with sides of length 'L.'
* Determine the number of points that fall within a unit circle centered at the origin and inscribed within the square.
* Calculate the ratio of points within the circle to the total number of generated points.
* Multiply the ratio by 4 to obtain an estimate of π, as the ratio represents the ratio of the areas of the circle and square.

By increasing the number of generated points, the accuracy of the estimate improves. The Monte Carlo method allows for a probabilistic estimation of π based on the random sampling of points and statistical analysis of their distribution.
